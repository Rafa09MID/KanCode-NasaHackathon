BioSearch is an intelligent web platform designed to explore, summarize, and visualize NASA’s 608 space bioscience publications. By leveraging artificial intelligence, vector-based search, and knowledge graph technologies, the tool enables users to quickly access relevant information about biological experiments conducted in space and understand their broader impacts.

The system automatically processes scientific texts, provides clear summaries and personalized visualizations, and classifies articles by topic, complexity level, and publication year. In doing so, BioSearch transforms complex scientific data into accessible knowledge for students, researchers, and educators—fostering interdisciplinary learning and scientific engagement.

This project addresses NASA’s challenge by democratizing access to space biology knowledge, advancing open science, and supporting the future of human exploration beyond Earth.
